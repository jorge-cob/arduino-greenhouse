This repo will hold iterations for an automated indoor plant/mushrooms growing system that will be measuring and regulating humidity and temperature. 

 - **v1_temp_and_humidty_tft:** Monitor temperature and humidty and display them in a TFT screen.

<br>

### Next Iterations (No specific order):
- Control a relay that can activate an airpump attached to a water recipient in order to increase the humidity when needed.
- Control a relay that can activate a heat bed in order to increase temperature when needed.
- Add an alert system when thresholds are reached.
- Make an API to remotely manage the system.
- Design a casing for the project.
